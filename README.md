# Unicorn-Startup-Valuation-Analysis

**📊 Unicorn-Startup-Valuation-Analysis**
Domain: Data Analytics
Tools: Machine Learning, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Difficulty Level: Intermediate

**📝 About Dataset**

The dataset focuses on Unicorn companies—privately held startups valued at over $1 billion. The term “Unicorn” was first popularized by venture capitalist Aileen Lee.

Apart from startups, “Unicorn” is also a recruitment term in HR, where managers look for rare, highly skilled candidates that may not realistically exist in the job market.

**🎯 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the valuation of companies using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

**🔑 Objectives**

1. Analyze financial and business metrics of Unicorn companies.

2. Build ML models to predict company valuation.

3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.

4. Deploy a machine learning model for valuation predictions.

**⚙️ Steps to Follow**

1. Define Scope & Objectives – Select companies and define valuation prediction goals

2. Data Collection – Gather financial data (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, etc.)

3. Data Preparation – Clean, preprocess, and integrate datasets

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and identify patterns

5. Feature Engineering – Create meaningful features, normalize data

6. Model Selection – Choose ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

7. Model Training & Evaluation – Train models, test on unseen data, measure performance

8. Model Tuning & Optimization – Apply hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
